=====================================
Signal recovery by 1D total variation
=====================================

In this example, we generate a signal that is piecewise constant. We then
observe some random and corrupted measurements from that signal and
then try to recover that signal using L1 and TV1D penalties.

Given a ground truth vectors, the signal that we observe is given by

     y = sign(X ground_truth + noise)

where X is a random matrix. We obtain the vector ground_truth by solving
an optimization problem using lightning's :class:`lightning.classification.FistaClassifier`.

The 1D total variation is also known as fused lasso.
